## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_specific_password
FRONTEND_URL=https://canovav1.vercel.app
```

## Frontend Integration
The backend is configured to work with the frontend deployed at `https://canovav1.vercel.app/`. The CORS policy is set up to allow requests from:
- https://canovav1.vercel.app
- http://localhost:3000 (for development)
- http://localhost:3001 (for development)

## Password Reset Flow
1. User requests password reset via `/api/auth/forgot-password`
2. Backend generates OTP and sends email with reset link
3. Reset link points to: `https://canovav1.vercel.app/reset-password?email=...&otp=...`
4. User verifies OTP via `/api/auth/verify-otp`
5. User resets password via `/api/auth/reset-password`

## Deployment Notes
- The backend is deployed on Render.com
- MongoDB should be hosted on MongoDB Atlas for production
- Email service uses Gmail SMTP with app-specific password
- All environment variables must be set in the deployment platform

## Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file with local configuration
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Production Deployment
1. Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster
2. Configure environment variables on Render.com
3. Deploy using: `npm start`

## Error Handling
- All routes include proper error handling and logging
- CORS errors are logged for debugging
- Database connection errors are handled gracefully
- Email failures don't block the password reset flow
